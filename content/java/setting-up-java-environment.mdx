# Setting Up Java Environment

This guide will help you set up your Java development environment. We'll cover installing the Java Development Kit (JDK), configuring environment variables, and choosing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Installing Java Development Kit (JDK)

1. Visit the official Oracle website or adopt OpenJDK site.
2. Download the latest version of JDK for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard.

### Verifying Installation

Open a command prompt or terminal and type:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

If installed correctly, you should see the version information for both commands.

## Configuring Environment Variables

### Windows

1. Right-click on 'This PC' and select 'Properties'.
2. Click on 'Advanced system settings'.
3. Click on 'Environment Variables'.
4. Under System Variables, click 'New' and add:
    - Variable name: JAVA_HOME
    - Variable value: Path to your JDK installation (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17)
5. Find the 'Path' variable, click 'Edit', and add '%JAVA_HOME%\bin'.

### macOS and Linux

Add the following to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk` with the actual path to your JDK installation.

## Choosing an IDE

Popular IDEs for Java development include:

1. **IntelliJ IDEA**: A powerful IDE with a free community edition and a paid ultimate edition.

2. **Eclipse**: A free, open-source IDE with a large plugin ecosystem.

3. **NetBeans**: Another free, open-source IDE that's particularly good for beginners.

### Installing an IDE

1. Download your chosen IDE from its official website.
2. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard.
3. During setup, ensure that the IDE is configured to use your installed JDK.

## Writing Your First Java Program

1. Open your IDE.
2. Create a new Java project.
3. Create a new Java class named `HelloWorld`.
4. Enter the following code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

5. Run the program to see "Hello, World!" printed in the console.

## Conclusion

You now have a basic Java development environment set up. With the JDK installed and an IDE configured, you're ready to start your Java programming journey!
