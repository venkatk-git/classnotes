# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of organizing code around **objects**. These objects combine **data** (called attributes) and **behavior** (called methods) that operate on the data.

## Why Use OOP?

OOP offers several advantages:

-   **Modularity**: Breaks programs into smaller, manageable parts (classes and objects).
-   **Reusability**: Makes it easier to reuse existing code in new programs.
-   **Maintainability**: Simplifies fixing bugs and making updates.
-   **Scalability**: Allows for easy addition of new features.

## Core Concepts of OOP

1. **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects.
2. **Object**: An instance of a class.
3. **Attributes**: The properties or characteristics of an object (e.g., `brand`, `speed`).
4. **Methods**: The actions or behaviors of an object (e.g., `start()`, `accelerate()`).

## Example: Car Class

### Defining the Class

```java
class Car {
    // Attributes
    String brand;
    int speed;

    // Methods
    void start() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is starting.");
    }

    void accelerate(int increment) { // Method
        speed += increment;
        System.out.println("New speed: " + speed);
    }
}
```

### Attributes

Attributes define the properties of an object:

```java
String brand;
int speed;
```

### Methods

Methods define the behavior of an object:

```java
void start() {
    System.out.println(brand + " is starting.");
}

void accelerate(int increment) {
    speed += increment;
    System.out.println("New speed: " + speed);
}
```

### Creating Objects

An object is an instance of a class. To create an object, we use the `new` keyword followed by a call to a constructor of the class.

```java
Car car1 = new Car(); // Object creation
car1.start();         // Using an object to call a method
```

This creates a new `Car` object with the specified brand, model, and year.

### Accessing Object Members

We can access the fields and methods of an object using the dot notation:

```java
System.out.println(myCar.brand);  // Outputs: Toyota
myCar.startEngine();  // Outputs: The Toyota Corolla is starting...
```
