# Introduction to Java

Java is a popular, versatile, and object-oriented programming language. It was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Since then, it has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

## Key Features of Java

1. **Object-Oriented**: Java is built around the concept of objects that contain data and code.

2. **Platform Independent**: Java follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy.

3. **Secure**: Java has built-in security features to write virus-free, tamper-free systems.

4. **Robust**: Java emphasizes early checking for possible errors and runtime checking.

5. **Multithreaded**: Java has built-in support for multithreaded programming.

## "Write Once, Run Anywhere"

Java's platform independence is achieved through the following process:

1. Java source code is compiled into bytecode.
2. Bytecode is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
3. JVM is specific to the platform it's running on, but interprets the same bytecode.

This allows Java programs to run on any device with a JVM without needing to be recompiled.

## Basic Java Program

Here's a simple Java program:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

This program, when run, will output "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Conclusion

Java's robustness, security features, and portability have made it a go-to language for many developers. Whether you're interested in mobile app development, web services, or enterprise software, Java provides a solid foundation to build upon.
