# Computer Networks Terminologies

## 1. Network

A network is a collection of computers, servers, network devices, and other devices connected to one another to allow the sharing of data.
An example of a network is the Internet, which connects millions of people all over the world.

## 2. Node

A node is any device that is connected to a network. It can be a computer, server, printer,
or any other device that can send or receive data.

## 3. Protocols

A protocol is a set of rules that govern how data is transmitted over a network. (eg., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, etc.)

## 4. IP Address

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It is used to identify and locate devices on a network.

## 5. Ports

Ports are used to identify specific services or applications running on a device.

<>
Ports are 16 bits numbers ranging from 0 to 65535.
The first 1024 ports are reserved for well-known services like HTTP (port 80), FTP (port 21), etc.
Ports from 1024 to 49151 are registered ports for some applications, and ports from 49152 to 65535 are dynamic ports.

## 6. Topology

Network topology refers to the physical or logical layout of a network. (eg., how computers are connected to each other). 
Common topologies include bus, star, ring, tree, and mesh.
