# Structure of Computer Networks

## 1. Network Components

Nodes, links, devices and protocols are the fundamental components of a computer network. 
Understanding these components is essential for designing, implementing, and managing networks effectively.

**Nodes**: Devices like computers, servers, and printers
**Links**: Physical or logical connections between nodes
**Devices**: Hardware components that facilitate network communication
**Protocols**: Rules and conventions for data exchange (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP)

## 2. Network Types

Computer networks can be classified based on their geographical scope and the technologies they use.

**Local Area Network (LAN)**: Covers a small, localized network area like a home, office.
**Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Covers a large geographical areas and connects multiple LANs (eg., The Internet).
**Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: Covers a city or metropolitan area.
**Personal Area Network (PAN)**: Small network for personal devices (eg., Bluetooth).

## 3. Network Topologies

Network topology refers to the physical or logical layout of a network (how devices are connected).

**Bus Topology**: All devices share a single communication line.
**Star Topology**: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
**Ring Topology**: Devices are connected in a circular loop.
**Mesh Topology**: Devices are interconnected with multiple paths.

## 4. Network Models (OSI Model - 7 Layers)

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes network communication.

**Layer 01 Physical**: Deals with raw bit transmission and physical connections.
**Layer 02 Data Link**: Handles data framing and MAC addressing.
**Layer 03 Network**: Manages data routing and IP addressing.
**Layer 04 Transport**: Ensures reliable data delivery (eg., TCP, UDP).
**Layer 05 Session**: Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.
**Layer 06 Presentation**: Translates data formats between applications & encryption.
**Layer 07 Application**: Supports end-user applications and services.

## 5. Network Devices

Network devices play a crucial role in the efficient transmission of data and maintaining network functionality.

**Switches**: Operate at Layer 2 to forward data within a LAN.
**Routers**: Operate at Layer 3 to route data between networks. **
**Access Points**: Enables wireless connectivity for devices.

## 6. Network Protocols

Protocols are rules that govern data exchange between devices on a network.

**TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: Core protocols (eg., IP, TCP, UDP).
**DNS (Domain Name System)**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Assigns IP addessess dynamically.

## 7. Network Security

Network security involves protecting data and resources from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

**Firewalls**: Monitor and control incoming/outgoing network traffic. Prevent unauthorized access.
**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Detect and respond to security threats.
**Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: Block malicious traffic and prevent attacks.
**VPN (Virtual Private Networks)**: Securely connect remote users to a private network.
**Encryption**: Secure data during transmission by encoding information.
