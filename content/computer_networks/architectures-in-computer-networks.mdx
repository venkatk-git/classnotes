# Architectures in Computer Networks

Computer networks are designed using various architectures to meet different requirements, such as scalability, performance, security, and fault tolerance.

## Types of Network Architectures

- Client-Server Architecture
- Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
- Distributed Architecture


### 1. Client-Server Architecture

 */

**Definition**: In a client-server architecture, the network is divided into two parts: clients and servers. Clients request services or resources from servers, which provide the requested services or resources.
**Examples**: Web servers, email servers, file servers, etc.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

**Definition**: In a peer-to-peer architecture, all nodes in the network can act as both clients and servers. Each node can request services or resources from other nodes and provide services or resources to other nodes. No central server is required.
**Examples**: BitTorrent, File sharing systems, etc.
