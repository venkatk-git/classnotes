# Intro to OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is developed as a way for standardized the communication between different systems. 

## OSI Model Layers

**Layer 01 Physical**: Deals with raw bit transmission and physical connections.
**Layer 02 Data Link**: Handles data framing and MAC addressing.
**Layer 03 Network**: Manages data routing and IP addressing.
**Layer 04 Transport**: Ensures reliable data delivery (eg., TCP, UDP).
**Layer 05 Session**: Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.
**Layer 06 Presentation**: Translates data formats between applications & encryption.
**Layer 07 Application**: Supports end-user applications and services.

### Layer 07 - Application Layer

**Responsiblity**: It is the end user applications that uses the network. It is the layer use interacts with.
**Examples**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.

### Layer 06 - Presentation Layer

**Responsiblity**: This layer is responsible for the data transilation between the user application to the network formats (like converting the data to binary format). It is also responsible for data encryton and data compression.
**Examples**: JPEG, GIF, SSL, etc.

### Layer 05 - Session Layer

**Responsiblity**: This layer is responsible for the session management between the application and the network. It is responsible for establishing, maintaining and terminating the session.
**Examples**: NetBIOS, RPC, etc.

## Layer 04 - Transport Layer

**Responsiblity**: This layer is responsible for the end-to-end tansmission of data. 
**Examples**: TCP, UDP, etc.

## Layer 03 - Network Layer

**Responsiblity**: It is responsible for routing the data from the source to the destination. It is responsible for the logical addressing and routing.
**Examples**: IP, ICMP, etc.

## Layer 02 - Data Link Layer

**Responsiblity**: This layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection. This layer manages the MAC (Media Access Control) addressing.
**Examples**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.

## Layer 01 - Physical Layer

**Responsiblity**: This layer is responsible for the physical connection between the network devices. And this layer is responsible for the physical transmission of data stream.
**Examples**: RJ45, Fiber Optics, etc.
