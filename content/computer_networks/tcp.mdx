# Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - Transport layer protocol

Application layer sends lots of raw data to the transport layer. TCP segments this into smaller chunks known as packets and then adds additional headers to this packets.
It may also collect the data from the network data and reassembles it into one single chunk. This is known as **segmentation** and **reassembly**. 
(Here, the data is divided into chunks and send it to the network layer, network layer divides this chunks into more smaller chunks)
