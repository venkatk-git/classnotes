# TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is used for network communication.
The TCP/IP model developed prior to the OSI model and is the foundation of the Internet.
It is not exactly same as the OSI model. It simplifies the OSI model into 4 layers

<>
    It is named after two of the most important protocols in the model:
    Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).
</>

## TCP/IP Model Layers

-   Application Layer
-   Transport Layer
-   Network Layer
-   Data Link Layer

### 1. Application Layer

-   **Responsiblity**: This is the layer where users interacts with. It lies in the user devices. Handles protocols that applications use for network communications.
-   **Protocols**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.
-   **Examples**: Whatsapp, Web browsers, email clients, etc.

<>
#### HTTP Protocol

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext over the Internet.
This is the protocol where web browsers and web servers communicate.
HTTP uses TCP as the transport layer protocol.
It is a stateless protocol.

**HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH etc..

</>

### 2. Transport Layer

-   **Responsiblity**: This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication. It ensures that data is transferred between devices reliably and accurately.
-   **Protocols**: TCP, UDP
-   **Examples**: TCP ensures reliable data transfer, UDP is used for real-time applications like video streaming, etc..

#### TCP Protocol
    -   **Checksum**: Checksum is a value that is calculated from the data in a
    packet. It is used to detect is something went wrong during the transmission
    process by comparing the sender's checksum and the receiver checksum.

    -   **Timers**: Timers are used to know weather the receiver is received the data. It ensures proper data termination when timeout occurs.

    -   **Sequence Number**: Sequence number is used to know the order of the data packets. It is used to reassemble the data packets in the correct order.

#### UDP Protocol

In UDP protocol, the data may not be recieved (there is no gaurentee that the data will be recieved). It may change during the transmission process. If the data is received it is not gaurenteed that the data order will be same as the sender.

<>
    - **Checksum**: Checksum values in UDP protocol still checks is the data is
    corupted or not. But, in case of data curroption, it will do nothing.
</>

### 3. Network Layer

-   **Responsiblity**: This layer is responsible for tranfer of data across the network. It handles the routing, addressing and packet forwarding.
-   **Protocols**: IP, ICMP, ARP
-   **Examples**: Routers, switches, etc..

<>
    #### IP Protocol - **IP Address**: IP address is a unique address assigned
    to each device connected to a network. - **IPV4**: These are 32-bit
    addresses with 4 words separated by dots. (eg., 192.168.1.1) - **IPV6**:
    These are 128-bit addresses with 8 words separated by colons. (eg.,
    2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)
</>

### 4. Data Link Layer

-   **Responsiblity**: This layer is responsible for the physical transmission of data. It handles the physical addressing, error detection and correction.
