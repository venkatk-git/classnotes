# Lazy Loading
In React, lazy loading can be handled with combination two API's `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

## React.lazy()
`React.lazy` is a function that lets us to render a dynamic import as a regular component.

<CodeBlock>
```jsx
// This line lets react to load the component lazily
const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));
```
</CodeBlock>

## Suspense
`Suspense` is a component that lets us to wait for some code to load and declare the loading state. Meanwhile, we can show some fallback UI.

<CodeBlock>
```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  // Lazy loaded Component
  <MyComponent />
</Suspense>
```
</CodeBlock>
