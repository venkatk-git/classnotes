# Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
SSR and CSR are two rendering strategies used in frontend development. By default, React applications use **Client-Side Rendering (CSR).**

## What is Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?
In CSR, the app is rendered entirely in the browser. The process works as follows:

1. The browser sends a request to the server.  
2. The server responds by sending the necessary files (HTML, JavaScript, CSS).  
3. The browser downloads the HTML page and JavaScript bundles.  
4. React executes in the browser and dynamically builds the UI.  

Since rendering happens on the client side, the **initial page load may be slower**, but **subsequent interactions are faster**.

## What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?
In SSR, pages are rendered on the **server** before being sent to the browser. This means users see content **immediately** instead of waiting for JavaScript execution.

1. The browser sends a request to the server.  
2. The server renders React components into **static HTML**.  
3. The server sends this **pre-rendered HTML** to the client.  
4. The browser displays the page immediately.  
5. The client downloads JavaScript and **hydrates** the app (makes it interactive).  

Since the content is pre-rendered, SSR is **better for SEO and initial page load times**. However, it requires **more server resources**.
