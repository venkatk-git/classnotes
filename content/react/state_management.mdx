States are mutable data that are used to render the UI. When the state changes, the component re-renders.
Props are passed into the component.

## Props Drilling
Props Drilling is the process of passing props from a parent component to a child component. 
This is a common pattern is React applications.

React contexts are used to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
When a state changes in the context, all the components that are subscribed to the context will re-render.

The `useReducer` hook is used to manage the state of a component. It is similar to the `useState` hook, but it is more powerful and flexible.

There are several state management libraries available in React. Some of the popular ones are:
- Redux
