# State & Props
States are mutable data that are used to render the UI. When the state changes, the component re-renders.
Props are passed into the component.
Props are immutable data that are used to render the UI. 

## Props Drilling
Props Drilling is the process of passing props from a parent component to a child component. 
This is a common pattern is React applications. 

## Context
React contexts are used to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
When a state changes in the context, all the components that are subscribed to the context will re-render.

## useReducer Hook
The `useReducer` hook is used to manage the state of a component. It is similar to the `useState` hook, but it is more powerful and flexible.
The `useReducer` hook takes two arguments: a reducer function and an initial state.

<CodeBlock>
```jsx
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment': return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'decrement': return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default: return state;
    }
}
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

dispatch({type: 'increment'});

// dispatch({type: 'dispatch_type', payload: data})
```
</CodeBlock>

## State Management Libraries
There are several state management libraries available in React. Some of the popular ones are:
- Redux
- Zustand

## Redux
Redux is more similar to the `useReducer` hook. It is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

<CodeBlock>
```jsx
// Same reducer as useReducer()
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment': return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'decrement': return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default: return state;
    }
}

const store = createStore(reducer); 

// In App component we have to wrap the component with this Provider
<Provider store={store}>
    <App />
</Provider>

// Then we can access the state and dispatch in any component of the App
const state = useSelector(state => state);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

dispatch({type: 'increment'});
```
</CodeBlock>

## Zustand
Zustand is a small, fast and easy to use state management library for React. It is similar to Redux but with a simpler API.

<CodeBlock>
```jsx
const useZustandState = create((set) => ({
    // Initial state
    count: 0,

    // Actions
    increment: () => set(state => ({count: state.count + 1}))
    incrementWithValue = (value) => {
        set(state => ({count: state.count + value}))
    }
}))

// Just export this state from the file and use it in any component
export default useZustandState;

// In any component
// Extract only necessary state values using selector
const { count, increment, incrementWithValue } = useZustandState(state => ({
    count: state.count,
    increment: state.increment,
    incrementWithValue: state.incrementWithValue
}));

console.log(count);
increment();
incrementWithValue(5);
```
</CodeBlock>
